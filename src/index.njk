faqs:
- q: What about The Virus That Must Not Be Named?
  a: First of all, COVID can get fucked, amiright? Second of all, we got this! We paid a little bit more for the Airbnb to be fully refundable, so if things go tits up between now and then, all money is refunded!
- q: $200 seems steep, can you break this down for me?
  a: Remember this is likely to not be the final cost, as accomodation is shared among everyone. Total for the house was $2455, and we've also budgeted $30/person for meals and sundry.
- q: If the murder mystery dinner is on the Saturday, WTF are we doing the rest of the time?
  a: Friday night we will be hanging out at the house and playing some games that help people get to know one another. Saturday we are thinking about touring a local gin distillery, Four Pillars. The rest of the time we will be eating, drinking, and being merry! And sleeping, mmmm sleeeeep
- q: COVID has left me with social anxiety, and I don't know many people coming. This concerns me.
  a: Babe, I get it, the anxiety is real. The good news is most people are in a similar boat, a lot of people are coming who don't know other people! We will make this experience as welcoming and friendly as possible, so don't be afraid, there is a big hug and warm smile waiting for you, and Stephen & Jerrard will be there too!
- q: How many people can we accomodate?
  a: The house can sleep 16 people comfortably. We also have 3 super high quality blow ups (1 double and 2 singles). If you are later to confirm your RSVP and the 16 beds are already taken, you may get a blow up, but you will owe a little less to compensate (you can volunteer for this if you like!).
- q: What if I just want to come for the murder mystery dinner and go home afterwards?
  a: This is totally fine! Just let us know and we will assign you a character etc. You will only need to pay a small amount to cover the cost of dinner and the game.

Each round you will be given some new information, as well as some guidance on who you need to talk to and what kind of questions you should ask. Each character will be given different information, and you may well be the murderer yourself! Duh-duh-duuuhhh!</p>

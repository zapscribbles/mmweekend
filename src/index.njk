faqs:
- q: How do I pay my $200?
  a: Send to BSB 944-600, Account 000556682, using your full name as the reference.
- q: What about The Virus That Must Not Be Named?
  a: First of all, COVID can get fucked, amiright? Second of all, we got this! We paid a little bit more for the Airbnb to be fully refundable, so if things go tits up between now and then, all money is refunded!
- q: $200 seems steep, can you break this down for me?
  a: Remember this is likely to not be the final cost, as accommodation is shared among everyone. Total for the house was $2455, and we've also budgeted $30/person for meals and sundry. You can also pay an additional $20 and we will go to a local second hand store and buy some stuff you could use for your costume!
- q: If the murder mystery dinner is on the Saturday, WTF are we doing the rest of the time?
  a: Friday night we will be hanging out at the house and playing some games that help people get to know one another. Saturday we are thinking about touring a local gin distillery, Four Pillars. The rest of the time we will be eating, drinking, and being merry! And sleeping, mmmm sleeeeep
- q: COVID has left me with social anxiety, and I don't know many people coming. This concerns me.
  a: Babe, I get it, the anxiety is real. The good news is most people are in a similar boat, a lot of people are coming who don't know other people! We will make this experience as welcoming and friendly as possible, so don't be afraid, there is a big hug and warm smile waiting for you, and Stephen & Jerrard will be there too!
- q: How many people can we accommodate?
  a: The house can sleep 16 people comfortably. We also have 3 super high quality blow ups (1 double and 2 singles). If you are later to confirm your RSVP and the 16 beds are already taken, you may get a blow up, but you will owe a little less to compensate (you can volunteer for this if you like!).
- q: What if I just want to come for the murder mystery dinner and go home afterwards?
  a: This is totally fine! Just let us know and we will assign you a character etc. You will only need to pay a small amount to cover the cost of dinner and the game.
- q: <i id="flights-faq-question"></i>I'm flying in from interstate, when should I book my flights for?
  a: <strong>If you're taking the Friday off</strong>, try and time your landing for around lunchtime or earlier. Some of us locals will be driving up in the afternoon, so you can ride with us. <br /> <strong>If you are flying after work</strong>, as early as possible. We will organise for locals who are leaving Melbourne after work to give you a lift. <br /> <strong>As for Sunday,</strong> as late as possible. We recommend not flying out any earlier than 4pm to avoid a rush. However if you need to get back earlier, we will figure it out!<br /><i>Feel free to message Stephen if you have any questions, and please <strong>forward him your itinerary</strong> once you've booked to help him keep track of everything.</i>
- q: What's the food situation?
  a: Food is included in the cost of the trip. We will buy enough groceries to cover everyone's meals, and don't worry - we will cook as much as possible before we go!
- q: I have a dietary requirement.
  a: We got you! Just let us know in the RSVP and we will cater for it.
- q: How intense is the costume situation?
  a: The costume situation can be as full on as you want it to be, as long as you are wearing some sort of costume you're good! As our local costume store says on <a href="https://www.centrestagecostumes.com">their website</a>, it's not the costume that matters, it's the fun you have in it. We may bring some miscellaneous wigs and things to help give people options. If you're in Melbourne, we thought we would go to the local costume shop and let them know about the party, so they can have some options prepared for people coming to check it out.  Check them out at https://www.centrestagecostumes.com
- q: Fuck gender norms, can I come as a gender other than my own?
  a: You absolutely can! We will ask this ahead of time and assign you a character of whichever gender you choose, regardless of your own gender identity.
- q: How much time will I have before the murder mystery night to find a costume etc?
  a: Once we have all numbers confirmed and the information we need from everyone, we will purchase the game and start assigning characters. You should expect to receive your character at least two or three weeks before the party.
- q: Why does this event require it's own website? Bit OTT mate 
  a: First of all, have we met? Second of all, Stephen is learning a new web technology and thought this would be a geat little project to try it out. Feel free to ask him about it if you're interested, and you have a spare three hours.
